# dailydemo

This is a web application that lets people create and share video calls, then view network metrics about these calls.

## Technology Used

This project has a React frontend with a Node.JS & Express backend. 
The [daily.co API](https://docs.daily.co/docs) was used to easily create and embed video calls, as well as obtain metrics about these video calls. 
The [recharts library](http://recharts.org/en-US/) was used to graph the metrics of these video calls.
